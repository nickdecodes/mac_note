## 修改zsh作为默认shell

[跳转](./01.Mac默认zsh.md)

```bash
cp .bash_profile .zprofile
```

## 安装oh-my-zsh

```bash
wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh
```

## 配置plugins

- [下载自动补全](https://mimosa-pudica.net/zsh-incremental.html)

```bash
cd .oh-my-zsh/plugins && mkdir incr && cp ~/incr-0.2.zsh .oh-my-zsh/plugins/incr/
# add to .zshrc at tail
# [plugins]
source ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/incr/incr*.zsh
# reload
source .zshrc
```

- 下载语法高亮

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git && mv zsh-syntax-highlighting .oh-my-zsh/plugins/
# add to .zshrc
plugins=(
	zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

## 常见问题

1.复制粘贴打字机现象

```bash
# 解决复制粘贴出现很慢的情况
pasteinit() { 
	OLD_SELF_INSERT=${${(s.:.)widgets[self-insert]}[2,3]} 
	zle -N self-insert url-quote-magic # I wonder if you'd need `.url-quote-magic`? 
} 
pastefinish() { 
	zle -N self-insert $OLD_SELF_INSERT 
}
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-init pasteinit 
zstyle :bracketed-paste-magic paste-finish pastefinish
```

## zshrc

```bash
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
# export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="/Users/zhengdongqi/.oh-my-zsh"

# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="random"

# Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
# Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
# a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
# If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=(
    "agnoster"
)

# Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
# Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.
# HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"

# Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled  # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto      # update automatically without asking
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder  # just remind me to update when it's time

# Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13

# Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"

# Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.
# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"

# Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.
# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"

# Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.
# You can also set it to another string to have that shown instead of the default red dots.
# e.g. COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="%F{yellow}waiting...%f"
# Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts in zsh < 5.7.1 (see #5765)
# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
# under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories
# much, much faster.
# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"

# Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time
# stamp shown in the history command output.
# You can set one of the optional three formats:
# "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
# or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
# see 'man strftime' for details.
# HIST_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"

# Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?
# ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/new-custom-folder

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(
	git
	zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

# Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,

# Example aliases
# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"
# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"
