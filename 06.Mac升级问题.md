## 问题3

```
You are using macOS 13.
We do not provide support for this pre-release version.
You will encounter build failures with some formulae.
Please create pull requests instead of asking for help on Homebrew's GitHub,
Discourse, Twitter or IRC. You are responsible for resolving any issues you
experience while you are running this pre-release version
```

解决方法

```bash
cd "$(brew --repo)" && git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master && brew update
```
